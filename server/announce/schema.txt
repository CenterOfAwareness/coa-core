COA Announce JSON-DB Schema

{ coa_announce : {
    global : {
      text : [global_message],
      presence : [presence_message]
    },
    systems : {
      [system_name] : [user_message]
    }
  }
}

[global_message] format:

{ from_system : string, // Must be a valid user on the COA server
  from_user : string,   // Must be non-empty, length <= LEN_ALIAS
  text : string         // Must be length > 0, printable <= 80, raw <= 160
}

[presence_message] format:

{ from_system : string, // Must be a valid user on the COA server
  from_user : string,   // Must be non-empty, length <= LEN_ALIAS
  action : string       // Must be length > 0, printable <= 80, raw <= 160
}

[user_message] format:

{ from_system : string, // Must be a valid user on the COA server
  from_user : string,   // Must be non-empty, length <= LEN_ALIAS
  to_user : string,     // Must be length > 0 && <= LEN_ALIAS
  text : string         // Must be length > 0, printable <= 80, raw <= 160
}

A [global_message] is sent to all online users on all systems.

A [presence_message] is sent to all systems, and is intended for consumption
and rerouting/redisplay by scripts (such as the COA client.)

A [user_message] is sent to one user on one system. The receiving system should
discard the message if that user is not online.

Restrictions on [*_message].text:

This service is intended for short, one-line messages. CTRL-A codes are
permitted.  CR & LF will be stripped.

The 'raw' length is the string length including all control characters (CTRL-A
codes, CR, LF, etc.).  This allows some overhead for colour codes.

The 'printable' length is strip_ctrl([*_message].text).length, or the number of
visible characters in the string.  The 80 character limit was chosen to keep
messages short (one line on an 80 column terminal).

Permissions:

Only write, subscribe, and unsubscribe operations are permitted.

All authenticated clients may subscribe to coa_announce.global.text and
coa_announce.global.presence.

All authenticated clients may write to coa_announce.global, subject to rate
limiting and [global_message] validation.

Only the COA server may write to coa_announce.presence.

Only a client authenticated as [system_name] may subscribe to
coa_announce[system_name].

All authenticated clients may write to coa_announce[system_name], subject to
rate limiting and [user_message] validation.

The COA server is exempt from [*_message].text restrictions and rate limits.
