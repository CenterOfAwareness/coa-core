{ coa_announce : {
    global : [global_message],
    [system_name] : [user_message]
  }
}

[global_message] format:

{ from_system : string, // Must be a valid user on the COA server
  from_user : string,   // Must be non-empty, length <= LEN_ALIAS
  text : string         // Must be length > 0, printable <= 80, raw <= 160
}

[user_message] format:

{ from_system : string, // Must be a valid user on the COA server

A [global_message] is sent to all online users on all systems.

A [user_message] is sent to one user on one system. The receiving system should
discard the message if that user is not online.

Restrictions on [*_message].text:

This service is intended for short, one-line messages. CTRL-A codes are
permitted.  CR & LF will be stripped.

The 'raw' length is the string length including all control characters (CTRL-A
codes, CR, LF, etc.).

The 'printable' length is strip_ctrl([*_message].text).length, or the number of
visible characters in the string.
